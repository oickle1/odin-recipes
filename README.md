After going through basics of CSS, the page has been
updated to include font families, auto size adjustment
of images, and the style sheet to show basic 
implementation of style in the page.

Here is the first attempt at creating a raw HTML 
site for the Odin project.

So far, I should be able to clone a repository, 
create and update files and directories in the shell,
and should also be able to create a basic website
only using HTML.
